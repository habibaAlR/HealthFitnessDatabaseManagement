Project Description:
This is an application for a Health and Fitness Club Management System implemented using Java and JavaFX. This system can be accessed as member, trainer, and administrative staff. 
Members are able to register and manage their profiles, establish personal fitness goals, and input health metrics. Members have a dashboard where they can view excercise routines. Members can also schedule training sessions with certified trainers. Additionally, they are able to register for group fitness classes. 
Trainers have the ability to manage their schedules and view member profiles.
Administrative Staff manage room bookings, monitor fitness equipment maintenance, update class schedules, oversee billing, and process payments for sessions and classes.
